This repo contains only the release version of the dirPagination module from my
[angularUtils](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination) repo. The sole purpose of this repo is to allow for convenient 
dependency management via Bower.

Actual development of this module occurs in the angularUtils project.

All documentation is also located in the [angularUtils project](https://github.com/michaelbromley/angularUtils/tree/master/src/directives/pagination).
